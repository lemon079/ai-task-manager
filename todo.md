# AI Task Automation

Your project should let users create, manage, and execute tasks automatically with the help of AI. Instead of just being a "to-do list," it becomes a smart orchestrator that can handle multi-step actions, integrate APIs, and respond intelligently.

## 🛠️ Main Features

### Task Management (Basic to Advanced)

- **Create, update, delete tasks.**
- **Categorize tasks** (e.g., work, personal, learning).
- **Add deadlines, reminders, and priorities.**
- Store tasks in your database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB).

### AI-Powered Task Assistant

- Users can enter tasks in natural language:
  - Example: “Remind me to call Ali tomorrow at 5 PM.”
  - AI parses and creates structured task data.
- AI can summarize all tasks:
  - Example: “What are my deadlines this week?”
- AI can suggest optimizations:
  - Example: “You have free time tomorrow 3-5 PM, should I move the study session there?”

### Integration with APIs

- **Email** (read/write).
- **Calendar** (Google Calendar or custom one).
- **Messaging** (WhatsApp, Telegram).
- **External APIs** (weather, news, finance).
- AI can call these tools using LangChain/agents.

### Multi-Agent System (Optional but Strong)

- **Planner Agent**: Breaks down tasks.
- **Executor Agent**: Calls APIs.
- **Summarizer Agent**: Gives the user updates.
- This makes your project stand out as more than a CRUD app.

## Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind + ShadCN/UI)

- **Dashboard** with task list + AI chat panel.
- **Calendar view** to visualize tasks.
- **Search and filter tasks.**

## Backend (Next.js API Routes or Express)

- **Auth** (NextAuth).
- **Task storage** (Postgres or Mongo).

## AI Layer

- Use **LangChain** (or LangGraph) with:
  - Local model (Ollama/Qwen).
  - Hosted model (OpenAI, Anthropic).
- Give AI context with user’s tasks.
- Teach AI to produce structured JSON output for consistent task automation.

## 🚀 User Flow Example

1. **User logs in.**
2. Types: “Remind me to submit assignment next Monday at 10 AM.”
   - AI parses → `{ title: "Submit assignment", date: "2025-09-01T10:00:00" }`.
   - System saves to DB.
3. At reminder time → AI can send a WhatsApp message/email.
4. Later user asks: “What’s my week looking like?” → AI summarizes calendar.

## 🔮 Why It’s Impressive

- Combines **MERN/PERN full-stack** + **AI agents** + **automation**.
- Extendable (can grow into a SaaS like Zapier/Notion AI competitor).
- Great for portfolio → shows frontend, backend, AI integration, and automation.
