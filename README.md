# 🧠 AI Task Manager

The **AI Task Manager** is an intelligent task management application that allows users to create, manage, and analyze tasks using **natural language**. It combines the power of **LangChain**, **Next.js**, and **AI agents** to deliver an automated productivity experience.

Users can interact with a **custom-built AI Task Manager Agent** that performs CRUD operations on tasks through conversational commands. The system also includes a **modern dashboard**, **AI-driven insights**, and **semantic memory** powered by **vector embeddings**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🗣️ AI-Powered Task Management
- Create, update, delete, or retrieve tasks using **natural language**.
- Powered by a **LangChain-based AI agent** with **tool-based reasoning**.
- Performs CRUD operations using structured **LangGraph workflows**.
- Integrates **vector embeddings** for intelligent task recall and semantic understanding.

### 🔍 Semantic Search with Vector Embeddings
- Tasks are **encoded into high-dimensional embeddings** using **LangChain’s embedding models**.
- Stored in **Pinecone Vector Database**, enabling **semantic similarity search**.
- Users can search naturally, e.g.:
  - “Show me tasks related to improving the dashboard UI.”
  - “What are my pending high-priority items?”
- Enables **Long-Term Memory (LTM)** for the AI agent, allowing it to retrieve relevant historical context based on meaning rather than keywords.
- Supports **re-indexing** and **automatic vector updates** whenever tasks are created, edited, or deleted.

### 📅 Smart Dashboard
- **Calendar View** to visualize tasks by date.
  - Displays visual pings for upcoming deadlines.
  - Clicking a date reveals tasks due on that day.
- **Task Table** to list tasks chronologically with **pagination (10 per page)**.
  - Displays **title**, **status**, **priority**, and **due date**.
  - Intelligent color coding for quick visual scanning.

### ⚙️ User Settings
- Manage personal configurations:
  - Time zone preference.
  - Toggle **email notifications**.
  - Define **daily reminder time**.
- Receives **automated email digests** containing:
  - AI-generated summaries.
  - Upcoming deadlines.
  - Personalized productivity tips.

### 📬 Email & Insights
- Daily summaries sent via **Nodemailer**.
- **LangChain models** generate productivity insights based on your task patterns.
- Offers actionable intelligence for improving focus and task management.

## 🧠 Memory & AI Architecture

| Memory Type | Description | Backed By |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Short-Term Memory (STM)** | Recent user queries and conversation context. | LangGraph / Session State |
| **Long-Term Memory (LTM)** | Persistent memory of tasks and their embeddings for semantic search. | Pinecone Vector Database |
| **Procedural Memory** | AI’s knowledge of available tools and actions (CRUD operations). | LangChain Tools |

This hybrid memory system allows the AI to combine **reasoning (STM)** and **retrieval (LTM)**, enabling both contextual understanding and factual recall.

## 🧩 Core AI Flow

1. The user inputs a natural language command (e.g., *“Show me tasks about deployment”*).
2. The LangChain agent parses intent and selects the appropriate tool.
3. The query is embedded using the **Embeddings Model**.
4. **Pinecone Vector Database** retrieves semantically similar tasks.
5. The AI formats and responds with contextual insights or executes the corresponding action (create, update, delete, search).

## 🧪 Example Prompts

You can test the system by interacting naturally with the AI agent:

### Create Tasks
- “Add a task to finish the analytics dashboard by Friday.”
- “Create a high-priority task for preparing slides for the AI presentation.”

### Retrieve Tasks (Semantic Search)
- “What tasks are related to the dashboard UI?”
- “Show me all pending tasks about Docker or deployment.”

### Update Tasks
- “Mark the task for reviewing pull requests as completed.”
- “Change the priority of the AI presentation slides to high.”

### Delete Tasks
- “Delete my task about renewing the passport.”
- “Remove the Docker setup task.”
